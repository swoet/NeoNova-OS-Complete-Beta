# RISC-V Architecture Backend

This directory will contain architecture-specific code for:
- JIT/bytecode execution backend
- CPU instruction translation for the portable execution layer
- Optimized routines for RISC-V

The OS core will use a portable bytecode/JIT execution layer, with this directory providing the RISC-V backend implementation.
