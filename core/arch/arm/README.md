# ARM Architecture Backend

This directory will contain architecture-specific code for:
- JIT/bytecode execution backend
- CPU instruction translation for the portable execution layer
- Optimized routines for ARM

The OS core will use a portable bytecode/JIT execution layer, with this directory providing the ARM backend implementation.
