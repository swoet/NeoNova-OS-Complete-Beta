// This would iterate through drivers, call their probe() function, and select one.
// Returns a pointer to the best matching Driver, or NULL if no suitable driver is found.

// --- (Conceptual) Higher-level functions that might use DeviceManager ---

// and attempt to find and attach suitable drivers for each detected device.
// This is a core part of the system's Plug and Play (PnP) logic.
// void DriverManager_ProbeAndAttachAllDevices();

// Called when a new device is detected (e.g., by DeviceManager after a bus scan or hotplug).
// The DriverManager will then try to find and attach a suitable driver.
// void DriverManager_NotifyDeviceDetected(Device* new_device);

// Called when a device is about to be removed.
// The DriverManager ensures its driver is detached.

// --- Discussion on Advanced/Hypothetical Driver Concepts ---
//
// Self-Learning Driver System / Dynamic Driver Generation:
//
// The idea of an OS that can "learn" to use unknown hardware or dynamically
// generate drivers is a highly advanced research topic and presents extreme challenges:
//
// 1.  Hardware Obscurity: Hardware vendors often do not publish detailed low-level
//     specifications needed to write a driver. Reverse engineering is complex,
//     time-consuming, and error-prone.
//
// 2.  Infinite Variability: The range of hardware behaviors, registers, command sets,
//     and initialization sequences is vast. A universal "learner" would need to
//     understand all potential hardware paradigms.
//
// 3.  Safety and Stability: Incorrectly interacting with hardware can cause system
//     instability, crashes, data corruption, or even physical damage to the hardware.
//     An AI-generated driver would need rigorous verification, which is a hard problem.
//
// 4.  Performance: Generic or dynamically generated drivers are unlikely to be as
//     performant as hand-tuned drivers written with specific knowledge of the hardware.
//
// 5.  Complexity of AI: The AI required would need to:
//     *   Infer hardware functionality from probing limited I/O ports, memory regions,
//         or standard interfaces (like PCI config space, USB descriptors).
//     *   Hypothesize register maps and command sets.
//     *   Generate executable code (driver logic) based on these hypotheses.
//     *   Test this code in a safe environment (sandboxed hardware access?).
//     *   Learn from failures and successes.
//
// Hypothetical Approaches (Far Future/Highly Speculative):
// *   Vast Hardware Knowledge Bases: An AI trained on terabytes of datasheets,
//     existing driver code, and hardware schematics.
// *   Formal Methods & Automated Reasoning: Using mathematical techniques to prove
//     properties of generated driver code or to infer hardware behavior.
// *   Standardized Hardware Description Languages: If hardware came with machine-readable,
//     comprehensive descriptions of its interface and behavior.
// *   Highly Abstracted Driver Models: Drivers written against extremely high-level
//     APIs, with the OS providing a "universal translation layer" (itself a huge challenge).
//
// Intelligent Driver Repository & Retrieval (More Feasible but Still Advanced):
// *   This involves a cloud-based, curated, and extensive database of known drivers.
// *   The OS would securely query this repository with detailed hardware IDs
//     (e.g., PCI VID/PID, ACPI IDs, USB VID/PID/SerialNumber).
// *   The repository would perform sophisticated matching (considering revisions,
//     firmware versions, OS compatibility).
// *   Drivers would be securely downloaded, verified (checksums, signatures), and installed.
// *   This is an evolution of current OS update mechanisms and driver stores, but
//     would need to be far more comprehensive and intelligent.
//
// Conclusion for NeoNovaOS (Conceptual Phase):
// For the current conceptual design, NeoNovaOS will rely on a traditional model of
// pre-written drivers that are registered with the DriverManager. The advanced
// concepts above are noted as long-term research directions rather than implementable
// features at this stage.
